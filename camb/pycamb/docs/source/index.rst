CAMB Python
==================================

CAMB is Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background, a cosmology code for calculating CMB and matter power spectra,
as well as general utility function for cosmological calculations. The main code is written in Fortran, which this
Python package encapulates for convenient python programming and plotting.
For an introduction to CAMB see the main `home page <http://camb.info/>`_ , and the
`CAMB python example notebook <http://camb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/CAMBdemo.html>`_ for a quick
introduction to how to use the CAMB Python package.
